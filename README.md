##Project Description:

Work Sample Exercise: Alphabetizer
Write a program that can read in a series of strings and output the strings with the characters in alphabetical order.
Capitalization does not matter for a character, but characters should be output in the same form that they were input. e.g. P should count the same as p, but be output as P.
Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored and not included in the output string.

Examples:
			"VirginiaTech" would be output as "aceghiiinrTV"
			"3 Blind Mice" would be output as "BcdeiilMn"
